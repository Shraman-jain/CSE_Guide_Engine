python adding two list elements many situations one requires find index wise summation two different lists possible applications day-day programming lets discuss various ways task performed method naive method method simply run loop append new list summation list elements similar index till reach end smaller list basic method achieve task output time complexity n auxiliary space n method using list comprehension shorthand explained technique list comprehensions usually quicker type hence must preferred perform kind programming tasks output time complexity n auxiliary space n method using map + add map also used input add operation map along two list map perform addition techniques extended mathematical operation possible output time complexity n auxiliary space n method using zip + sum sum perform index-wise addition list zipped together using zip quite elegant way perform particular task output time complexity n auxiliary space n
